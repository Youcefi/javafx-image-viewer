## Prerequisites 📋

Before running the Image Viewer Application, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

* **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Make sure you have JDK 8 or higher installed on your machine.

* **JavaFX**: Since the Media Player Application is built using JavaFX, you need to have JavaFX properly set up in your project. If you're using JDK 11 or later, JavaFX is no longer bundled with it. You can download JavaFX from the OpenJFX website and configure it based on your specific IDE or build tool.
